## Features and Benefits

## Customizable layout design

The Angular File Manager UI consists of a toolbar, navigation pane, and content pane through which the files or folders in the file system can be accessed and managed. The component's entire layout can be customized with features like right-to-left alignment, enabling or disabling the toolbar and navigation pane, and switching between views.

## File operations

The Angular File Manager component includes all the common operations needed for managing a file system: copy, move, upload, download, edit, create, delete, and sort.

## Sorting

Files and folders in the file system can be sorted in either ascending or descending order simply by clicking the column header. Files and folders can be sorted based on name, date created, size, and other details.

## Searching

The Angular File Manager component contains built-in search functionality that allows you to search for and access a file or folder in the current path and its child folders.

## Moving files and folders with drag and drop

Files and folders can be moved within the file system by dragging and dropping them. Drag-and-drop support can be turned on or off.
